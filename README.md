# ``#emit`` directive

This directive is unlisted in the pawn-lang.pdf table however does exist. It is basically an inline compiler, if you know AMX you can use this to put AMX opcodes directly into your code. The one limitation is that it allows only one argument. Syntax: #emit <opcode> <argument> <argument> can be rational number, integer or (local or global) symbol(variables, functions and labels). The list of opcodes and their meaning can be found in Pawn Toolkit ver. 3664.
